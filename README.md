# BlogPost UI
__To use the UI to its fullest potential, configure a local DB using this [SQL Server Management Tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16) and connect it to the [API](https://github.com/DiegoFraR/BlogPost.API) of this project.__
This project was created in conjunction with the [ANGULAR and ASP.NET Core RESTP API - Real World Application](https://www.udemy.com/course/real-world-app-angular-aspnet-core-web-api-and-sql/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING) tutorial by [Sameer Saini](https://www.udemy.com/user/sameer-saini-4/)

## Environment
This application works on machines that have Windows 10+. This application was developed in a Windows environment, using Visual Studio Code. 
### *Note: This application was not tested on MacOS/Linux devices. This application may be incompatible with these OS's.*

To prepare your environment to execute this API:
1. [Install Angular 16.0.02 on your machine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/cli/v/16.0.2)
2. Open your Terminal to a location where you wish to store this application.
3. Clone this GitHub Repository using the ___git clone___ command in the command line/terminal. (Shown Below)
   ```` bash
   git clone https://github.com/DiegoFraR/BlogPost-UI
   ````

## Executing the UI

1. Ensure you have completed all the required steps in the previous [Environment](#environment) section.
2. Using the terminal/command line, navigate to the src directory of this project using the cd command.
3. Once in this directory, run the following command:
```` bash
npm start
````
4. Now the API will run on https://localhost:4200.
5. You can open any web browser (Chrome is preferred) and navigate to the URL: *https://localhost:4200*.
